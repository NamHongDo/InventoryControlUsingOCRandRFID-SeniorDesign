# InventoryControlUsingOCRandRFID-SeniorDesign

This senior project is completed by Nam Do (Software Lead-Computer Science), Ryan Metzler (Secretary and Presenter - Electrical Engineer), Paul Scaccia (Coordinator - Electrical Engineer), Joe Masar (RFID technology - Computer Engineer), Nick Cerutti(physical system workframe designer - Mechanical engineer), Pierre Jackson( software assistance - Computer Science).  

The system was originally requested by Zin Technologies. The final product is required to successfully scan labels and RFID tags using OCR and RFID technology respectively. A spread sheet with detail information (item id, time stamp, name, quantity) of the tags is printed out.

The system software is written using Ubuntu operating system, open-source softwares such as Qt UI development framework for C++,  Tesseract(OCR technology), Open-CV(Computer Vision Library).

In order for the source code to work, dependencies for Tesseract, OpenCV and Qt must also be installed into linux root.

Please read the Final Report for futher detail.
